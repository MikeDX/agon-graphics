# Agon Light 2 Graphics Demos

These are various random graphics demos that test out parts of the VDP. You will need the Console 8 versions of the Agon's operating system for these to work.

You'll need the "AGDev" C compiler already installed and working before this will be any use.

The "Tools" folder contains useful utilities, but they're designed for me and come with no documentation!

It's best if you poke around the source, and have a look at the code.

* Running "make" will compile things
* Running "make emulate" will also copy the relevant code into the fake SD card and start the emulator, you will need to copy any resources yourself. It will also edit/create an autoexe.txt file in the fake SD card folder so your code starts immediately. Copy the autoexec.txt first if you've customised it.
